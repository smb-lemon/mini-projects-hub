## Menu-Items

### Title Component

First, we need to create a Title component to display the main title of your app. This component can be a simple function that returns a heading element with the app title.

### Explore and Import Data

Import the menu items data from data.js into your project. This data should be an array of objects, with each object representing a menu item and containing properties such as title, price, image URL, and description.

### State Value

Setting up the menu items data as a state variable in the App.jsx component using the useState hook. This will allow you to modify the data and have those changes automatically reflected in the rendered output.

### Render Items

Passing the menu items state value down to the Menu.jsx component. In the Menu component, iterate over the list of menu items using the map method, and for every item, render a MenuItem component.

In the MenuItem component, render an image element, a title, a price, and a description. We can use the data from the menu items array to fill in the information for each component.
