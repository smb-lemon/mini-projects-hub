### Remove Tour

To implement the "remove tour" functionality, you can add a button to each Tour component that, when clicked, removes the tour from the list of tours. 
You can achieve this by updating the state of the Tours component to remove the tour from the tours array.

### Read More

To implement the "read more" functionality, you can add a button to each Tour component that, when clicked, expands the description of the tour. 
You can achieve this by updating the state of the Tour component to toggle a "read more" flag, and conditionally rendering the full description based on the flag.

### Re-fetch Tours

Finally, you can implement a "re-fetch" functionality by adding a button or other user interface element that, when clicked, re-fetches the tours data from the URL 
and updates the state of the Tours component. You may also want to add a loading state again during the re-fetching process.

Overall, the flow of the application should look something like this:

- App.jsx fetches tours data from a URL and sets the state of the Tours component to store the data.
- The Tours component maps over the tours array and renders a Tour component for each tour.
- Each Tour component has a "remove tour" button and a "read more" button.When the "remove tour" button is clicked, the Tours component updates its state to remove 
the tour from the tours array.

- When the "read more" button is clicked, the Tour component updates its state to toggle a "read more" flag and conditionally renders the full description.

- When the "re-fetch" button is clicked, the Tours component re-fetches the tours data from the URL and updates its state.
